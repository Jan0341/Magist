# Magist Project - Analysis of a data set from ENIAC 

This project involves analyzing a data set in MySQL from the fictitious Company Magist in Brazil, which may want to cooperate with our company Eniac in Spain for a possible Expansion to the Brazialan Tech-Market. Eniac sells high-end Tech Products from Apple.

The aim of the analysis was to answer the following two questions: 

1. is Magist able to deliver our products fast enough in Brazil
2. would Magist be a good partner for Eniac.

# About Eniac:

Eniac is an online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories. It was founded ten years ago in Spain and has since grown and expanded to other neighboring countries.
In addition to offering a wide catalog of products at competitive prices, Eniac provides friendly and professional tech support and consultation to its customers. The warmhearted spirit that thrives with direct contact with the customers is at the core of the company.

Since the company went public, investors have been pushing for Eniac to scale up the business and become a major e-commerce player globally. It goes without saying that it is an arduous challenge to do so while retaining the human side of the business, which is Eniacâ€™s emblem.
